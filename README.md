## Description
  
This Node application takes information about employees on a software development team and generates and HTML webpage that displays summarized cards for each individual. Teams are centered on a Manager and seeded with Engineers and Interns. Managers have an Office Number as an additional detail added to their card, Engineers have a link to their GitHub, and Interns have their school’s name.  The application files include test files to ensure your code and input are working properly.
